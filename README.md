> This is VERY MUCH in the early stages. Not suitable for production at all. But you can star ⭐ this repo and get notified when we post our first public release!
> Or you can build it yourself, though it's not ready yet.


## Vision 🎯

I'm very frustaded with some editors feature gating a bunch of stuff in their own models, using your own APIs is pratically unusable. I know, I know. They also need to pay the bills, that's fair. But even paying having some errors in my screen and not being able to put my own API key...

We'll, just complain won't solve anything. Let's build something better!

## Features ✨

- **Automatic Context Generation** 🧠: Intelligently understands your codebase and provides relevant context for smarter coding assistance
- **Treesitter Based Document Symbols** 🌳: Advanced code parsing and symbol recognition for improved code navigation and understanding
- **Git Based Workflow** 🔄: Seamless integration with Git for efficient version control and collaboration
- **Terminal Execution and Debugging** 💻: Built-in terminal support for running commands and debugging directly within the editor
- **Pinned Prompts** 📌: AI convention-based system for consistent and customizable AI interactions

## License

I'm not sure yet. Some of the collaboration features will be probabily licensed under a commercial one when you pass a given amout of users. But we'll always offer a self-hosted version and you'll be always welcome to use your own model (aka, no more "resource_exhausted" errors).
